<h1><span class="header-section-number">1</span> Creating railway station isochrones with QGIS</h1>
<p>The goal was to create isodistance curves as well as isochrones when traveling
by foot and by bike to all railway stations in the Helsinki region. Since HSL
uses OpenStreetMap for routing to railway and metro station platforms, the data
available in OpenStreetMap is high quality and can be used as such. At some
stations, some entrances and paths were updated in OpenStreetMap before the analysis.</p>
<p>The process takes place in a few steps:</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.1</span> How to find stations and platform entrances on Overpass API</h2>
<p><a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API">Overpass API</a> is the official API to access OpenStreetMap data,
and it is queried using the <a href="https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Overpass_API/Overpass_QL">Overpass Query Language</a>.</p>
<p>All the railway platforms in HSY area are in OSM as multipolygons, polygons or
linestrings. Polygons and linestrings are ways (closed or open) in OpenStreetMap.
In case of a multipolygon platform (Ilmala, Rautatieasema), it is a relation
instead. Overpass query to get nodes that make up the railway platforms is as follows:</p>
<pre><code>(
  (
    way[&quot;railway&quot;=&quot;platform&quot;]({{bbox}});
    node(w);
  );
  (
    rel[&quot;railway&quot;=&quot;platform&quot;]({{bbox}});
    way(r);
    node(w);
  );
)-&gt;.platform_nodes;</code></pre>
<p>Go through all the nodes in the platforms and find attached walkways:</p>
<pre><code>(
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;steps&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;elevator&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;footway&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;pedestrian&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;path&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;foot&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
);
node(w)-&gt;.walkway_nodes;</code></pre>
<p>Find the nodes that are attached to both walkways and platforms:</p>
<pre><code>node.platform_nodes.walkway_nodes;
out geom;
</code></pre>
<p>On some stations, this will return extra points on the platform edges that could
be removed from the analysis without affecting the results. However, they
will only slow down the analysis a little, so it makes no sense to go
through every point and check if it is strictly needed.</p>
<p>So, our complete Overpass query becomes</p>
<pre><code>(
  (
    way[&quot;railway&quot;=&quot;platform&quot;]({{bbox}});
    node(w);
  );
  (
    rel[&quot;railway&quot;=&quot;platform&quot;]({{bbox}});
    way(r);
    node(w);
  );
)-&gt;.platform_nodes;
(
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;steps&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;elevator&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;footway&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;pedestrian&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;highway&quot;=&quot;path&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
    way[&quot;foot&quot;]({{bbox}})(bn.platform_nodes);
);
node(w)-&gt;.walkway_nodes;
node.platform_nodes.walkway_nodes;
out geom;</code></pre>

<div id="how-to-save-the-results-of-the-query" class="section level2" number="1.2">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.2</span> How to save the results of the query</h2>
<p>The easiest way to get <em>all</em> nodes in the query is the Overpass Turbo
service <a href="https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1du9" class="uri">https://overpass-turbo.eu/s/1du9</a> . Zooming the map automatically sets the
<code>bbox</code> variable for the overpass query, so make sure the map is zoomed to the area you want and
click Run.</p>
<div class="figure">

<p class="caption">Overpass Turbo</p>
</div>
<p>Verify that the results contain all the nodes that you wish to include. At
the time of the writing, some errors were fixed and missing connections to the platforms
were added to OSM. Most platform entrances were already correct, thanks to HSL
editors over the years. Some stations (notably Ilmala, Kerava and Järvenpää)
required connecting paths to the platforms or creating proper platform polygons.
The fixes were done by comparing aerial photographs and <a href="https://www.hsl.fi/matkustaminen/tulostettavat-aikataulut-ja-kartat#asemakartat">HSY station platform
schematics</a>
to the overpass query results.</p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/kerava.png" title="Entrances to Kerava platforms" alt="" />
<p class="caption">Entrances to Kerava platforms</p>
</div>
<p>OSM editors may always make new errors and remove accidentally some of the
connections on the stations. Especially stairs and elevators are not always
properly connected to the platform edges by OSM editors, and this means they
may be missing in future results. If there are missing entrances, please fix
all the data in OSM by connecting them to the platform polygons/linestrings
before continuing.</p>
<p>After the query is finished, the data can be exported by clicking
on Export. At the time of the writing the number of nodes is 725. Save the
file as e.g. entrances.geojson, open it in QGIS and verify that all the nodes are present.</p>
<p>To group platform entrances by station name, we also want the station points.
This is done with a simple Overpass query</p>
<pre><code>node[&quot;railway&quot;=&quot;station&quot;]({{bbox}});
out geom;</code></pre>
<p>Run this and save the results as e.g. stations.geojson.</p>
<p>Note that “Pasilan autojuna-asema” should be removed manually from both stations
and entrances, since it doesn’t offer any local traffic.</p>
<div class="note-box">
<p>Missing future Länsimetro stations were added as points located at the
underground metro platforms. This is the same way existing metro station
locations are saved in OpenStreetMap.</p>
<p>Missing future Länsimetro station <em>entrances</em> were approximated based on public plans and
schematics materials offered by Espoo around each of the Länsimetro stations. All
station plans offer links to detail plans and reference schematics on the planned
buildings at each future station, so the location of the doors (and levels) at each entrance can
be approximated. <a href="https://kartat.espoo.fi/IMS/?layers=Opaskartta&amp;lon=Vireillä%20olevat%20asemakaavat&amp;lon=Ajantasa-asemakaava&amp;cp=6669917,25481609&amp;z=0.25">An example link to the plans around the Soukka station.</a></p>
<div class="figure">
<img src="img/soukka.png" title="An example of Soukka reference plan" alt="" />
<p class="caption">An example of Soukka reference plan</p>
</div>
<p>In addition, Länsimetro provided a table that contains internal walking distances in
meters + seconds on escalator/elevator from the metro platform to each of the entrances
at different levels. These numbers were added individually to each mapped entrance to take into account later.</p>
</div>
<p>Giving each platform entrance the name of the railway station is easiest
done with the QGIS Vector analysis tool “Distance to nearest hub (reference points)”.
This will generate a point layer that contains the name of the station
(and distance of the entrance to the station node):</p>

<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.3</span> How to setup Graphhopper server and QGIS plugin</h2>
<p><a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper">Graphhopper</a> is an open-source routing
engine that uses OpenStreetMap roads and paths out of the box. It is most easily installed
directly on an empty Ubuntu server with Java VM and their own <a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper#installation">README instructions</a>:</p>
<pre><code>sudo apt update
sudo apt install default-jre
wget https://graphhopper.com/public/releases/graphhopper-web-4.0.jar https://raw.githubusercontent.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/4.x/config-example.yml</code></pre>
<p>The <code>config-example.yml</code> file has to be updated to activate walk and bike routing,
and to allow access to the server from outside:</p>
<pre><code>profiles:
    - name: hike
        vehicle: hike
        weighting: shortest
    - name: bike
        vehicle: bike
        weighting: custom
        custom_model: {
          &quot;speed&quot;: [
            {
              &quot;if&quot;: &quot;true&quot;,
              &quot;limit_to&quot;: 15
            },
            {
              &quot;if&quot;: &quot;road_class == MOTORWAY&quot;,
              &quot;multiply_by&quot;: 0
            }
          ]
        }
...
server:
  application_connectors:
  - type: http
    port: 8989
    # COMMENT OUT THE NEXT LINE!
    # bind_host: localhost</code></pre>
<p>The hiking profile has speed of 5 km/h on flat ground (3 km/h on stairs). The bike
profile speed varies from 2 km/h (when pushing the bike on stairs on stations) all
the way to 15 km/h (when riding the bike on a separate bike lane). If a regular
(not custom) bike profile is used instead, the maximum speed will be 18 km/h.</p>
<p>Finally, the local OSM extract has to be downloaded and GraphHopper has to be
started with enough memory for the Java VM:</p>
<pre><code>wget https://download.geofabrik.de/europe/finland-latest.osm.pbf
java -Xmx12g -Xms12g -Ddw.graphhopper.datareader.file=finland-latest.osm.pbf -jar *.jar server config-example.yml</code></pre>
<p>First startup will be slow. GraphHopper will read the whole Finland extract and
construct routing graphs for all the modes listed in the config file. If you change
config or want to update the data, you have to delete the <code>graph-cache</code> directory
and restart Graphhopper.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/GispoCoding/school-catchment-plugin">Catchment QGIS plugin</a>
needs to be installed from the <a href="https://plugins.qgis.org/plugins/Catchment/">QGIS Plugins repository</a>. Start up the plugin
and fill in your Graphhopper URL (e.g. <a href="http://52.59.201.37:8989" class="uri">http://52.59.201.37:8989</a> or wherever your
installation is) in the Settings tab.</p>

<div id="how-to-calculate-isochrones" class="section level2" number="1.4">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.4</span> How to calculate isochrones</h2>
<p>Then you may calculate the isochrone for any layer in QGIS by selecting
the layer name, distance in meters or minutes and, if you selected minutes,
the mode of transport, i.e. Walking or Cycling. This way you can calculate
isochrones for all the station points. Distance divisions may be set to 10
to calculate all distances from 200 to 2000 meters at the same time, or 3
to calculate distances of 5, 10 and 15 minutes.</p>
<p>Calculating isochrones for all entrances to each station means we want to combine
all isochrones for all the entrance points of the same station. This is why we
saved the station name for each entrance point. Combining all isochrones for
entrances to the same station can be done by selecting the “Merge areas with same
value in” checkbox, and selecting “HubName”. “HubName” is the field QGIS used to save
the name of the station for each entrance. Calculating isochrones for all entrances
takes a lot longer, because we have anything from 1 to 50 entrances to a single station,
depending on the station.</p>
</div>
<div id="results" class="section level2" number="1.5">
<h2><span class="header-section-number">1.5</span> Results</h2>
<p>The results look slightly different from the old 2015 isochrones. There are two main
reasons for this: 1) different method of dividing area between roads and 2) more varied
speed profile for bicycles.</p>
<p>Point 1) means Graphhopper currently divides the area between roads by snapping to
any road closest to a point, regardless of distance. This may result in very ugly
isochrones in areas where there are no roads, such as woods and lakes. A suggestion
to improve Graphhopper isochrones by introducing a buffer around each road is
in progress (<a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/2377" class="uri">https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/issues/2377</a>).</p>
<p>Point 2) means Graphhopper has a rather advanced model of estimating bike speeds.
Our bike profile varies bike speed from 15 km/h (on paved bike lanes) to much less
(on uneven surfaces and forest paths). The speed when walking the bike
(e.g. on train platforms) is 4 km/h, and speed on stairs is even lower. This means
the bike speeds will be slower than in the old model when the bike is
walked or along narrow paths; and the bike speed is highest if there is a paved
bike-only lane available. The full code that determines bike speed and route preference
can be found in Graphhopper source: (<a href="https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/b65d9413e2dc29b662a1bb2db146b536471167a9/core/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/routing/util/BikeCommonFlagEncoder.java" class="uri">https://github.com/graphhopper/graphhopper/blob/b65d9413e2dc29b662a1bb2db146b536471167a9/core/src/main/java/com/graphhopper/routing/util/BikeCommonFlagEncoder.java</a>).</p>
